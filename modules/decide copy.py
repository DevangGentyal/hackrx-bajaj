**Decision + Explanation + Clause reference as Proof**

### RULES:
1. Use only the provided clauses.
2. Return a **single sentence** per answer.
3. Answer must include: decision, explanation, and exact clause proof.
4. Always include all important figures, dates, durations, and conditions.
5. Use exact terms from clauses (do not generalize).
6. Do not add assumptions, background, or filler phrases.
7. Always include exceptions or special conditions if mentioned.
8. Never use vague terms like "as per clause 2" ‚Äî instead, quote the clause title or reference exactly as given.

One concise line that clearly follows:  
Decision + Explanation + Clause Proof
